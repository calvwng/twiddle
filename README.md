CPE 409 Twiddle App

# Vision And Scope:

Twiddle is an Android mobile application that enables users to discover fun and entertaining nearby activities. Upon opening the app, the user's GPS location will be detected and the user will be presented a list of nearby activities that have been crowdsource by the nearby community. The user will also be able to submit their ideas in mind. Our target audience includes anyone who is looking for something to do. Our application will not be a review tool but more for discovery and exploring new opportunities.
